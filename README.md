# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results
- Data Preprocessing
  - The IS_SUCCESSFUL variable is considered to be the target for the model 
  - The variables considered to be the features for the model are CLASSIFICATION and APPLICATION TYPE
  - EIN and NAME were neither targets nor features, and were removed from the input data
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model 

## Summary 
My optimization attempts were not successful at creating a model w/ a 75%+ predictive accuracy level. Deep Learning models are complicated to set up and take a bit of time, so Random Forest Classifiers may help solve this classification problem better since they are less complex.
